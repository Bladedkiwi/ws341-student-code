# CSE 341 Lesson 3 Class Activity Steps

There isn't an official starting zip file for this class activity. Instead, you should use your assignment submission for lesson 2. If, for whatever reason, that is not an option, you may adopt [this code](https://github.com/byui-cse/cse341-code-student/tree/L02-personal-solution) as a starting point for your project this week and for this class activity.

Follow the steps listed in [this article](https://dev.to/knowankit/setup-eslint-and-prettier-in-react-app-357b).

A couple of things to look out for...

- Don't include anything about React
- Select Node and JSON (not Browser and JavaScript)
- Add "jest": true
